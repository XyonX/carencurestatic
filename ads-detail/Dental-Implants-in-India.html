        The concept of teeth replacement dates  back in China at around 4000 years ago,where they used bamboo as implants.  Dental implants in India as well have paved way for better orthodontic  techniques. Dental implants (scientific name Endosseous implant/ fixture) are  surgical components that support a dental prosthesis viz crown, bridge,  denture, facial prosthesis by interfacing with bone of jaw or skull, also  acting as orthodontic anchor. These implants connect with components such as an  abutment that serves as a connection to the dental prosthesis.
        <br/>
        A biologic process called  osseointegration causes the dental implant to fuse with the bone. Before the  discovery of the process, several non-titanium implants were placed in the  jawbones but they caused complications due to foreign body reactions. But with  medical advancement, material such as titanium or certain ceramics were used to  form the bone integration.
        <br/>
        The osseointegrated dental implants  ensure healthy bone and gingiva. Sometimes, pre-prosthetic procedures are  needed to recreate ideal bone and gingiva for implant placement, particularly  after atrophy from previous tooth removal. Healthy tissues also ensure a well  integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads and mean long term  success rates of 93 to 98 per cent for the fixture with 10 to 15 year lifespan  of the prosthetic teeth. Dental implants help retain artificial teeth, facial  prosthetics and also act as anchor points for orthodontics.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A dental implant also supports replacement  of missing teeth. The osseointegration process support physical loads for  decades. For individual tooth replacement, an implant abutment is secured to  the implant with an abutment screw, and a crown (dental prosthesis) is then  connected to the abutment with dental cement, a small screw, or fused with the  abutment as one piece during fabrication. Dental implants can retain a multiple  tooth dental prosthesis either in the form of a fixed bridge or removable  dentures.
        <br/>
        An implant-supported dental bridge/denture  is a multiple tooth dental prostheses. These bridges connect to more than one  implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Implant supported  bridges attach to abutments just like a single tooth implant replacement. A  fixed bridge replacement may vary from &nbsp;two teeth (fixed partial denture)  to an entire arch of teeth (fixed full denture). The prosthesis is said to be  fixed in both cases because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.
       </p>
       A  removable implant supported denture/ overdenture is a kind of dental  prosthesis, not permanently fixed in place. The prosthesis can be disconnected  from the implant abutments with finger pressure by the wearer. For this, the  abutment is given the shape of a small connector (a button, ball, bar or magnet)  which can be connected to analogous adapters in the underside of the dental  prosthesis. Facial prosthetics, used to correct facial deformities (e.g. from  cancer treatment or injuries), can utilise connections to implants placed in  the facial bones.
