        The toothless no more need to be  concerned about wearing dentures as the modern-day dentistry implant techniques  are to the rescue. These techniques offer immediate functionality with  sustainable life of the implants.
        <br/>
        This treatment comprises a prosthesis solidly held in place, by four dental  implants (&lsquo;All-on-Four&rsquo; Procedure), which provides comfort and security, a  patient is likely to be missing with removable dentures, and also preserves  bone in the jaw.
        <br/>
        Apart from receiving a fully customized set of replacement teeth in just a day,  another remarkable benefit afforded by the procedure is its ability to almost  always bypass the need for bone grafting - a surgery frequently required by  more traditional treatment for patients with substantial loss of bone in the  jaw.
        <br/>
        The &lsquo;All-on-Four&rsquo; procedure eliminates day-to-day frustrations and discomforts  of dentures, and patients can once again enjoy the dietary freedom with natural  teeth. It is the most sophisticated solution there is to tooth loss and  edentulism. The technology has made its way in to and across several hospitals  in India, and the cost of the surgery is trivial in front of the end result.

        The procedure
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Traditional approaches to restoring a full arch of teeth usually involved bone  grafts, six or more implants, and as many as 18 months of treatment. That means  that a patient often would be without any teeth or with ill-fitting temporary  dentures for more than a year.
       <br/>
       With the All-on-four Dental Implant Procedure, the patient has one or two  visits to our office to allow the Oral Surgeon and Restorative Dentist to  gather information for a treatment plan (e.g., CAT scan, X-rays, impressions,  photos). Following this consultation, the patient is scheduled for surgery  implantation and the new teeth are fitted and adjusted within 24 hours (even  when extractions are necessary).
       <br/>
       The patient will have to make occasional visits for check-up over the next  several weeks and months. After almost six months, when the gums have fully  healed and the implants are fused to the natural bone, we will take new  impressions of the patient's mouth and prepare a final, stronger, permanent set  of teeth adjusted to a perfect fit. This helps ensure the longest life of the  teeth, and provide maximum support, beauty, and function to the patient.
