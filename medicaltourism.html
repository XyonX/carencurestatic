      Health Care Regulations for Medical Tourism To India
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are fewer regulations, regarding health in India, applicable to
      foreign tourists. These regulations are more of the nature of prevention
      than anything else.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-2">
      <li>WHO website for International Travelers.</li>
      <li>WHO India</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="font-16 colorpink">Yellow Fever</h2>
    <p>
      Any person (including infants) arriving by air or sea without a
      certificate can be detained in isolation for a period up to 6 days if
      arriving within six days of departing from an infected area or has been in
      such an area in transit, or has come by aircraft which has been in an
      infected area and has not been disinfected in accordance with Indian
      Aircraft (Public Health) Rules, or those recommended by WHO. Various
      countries in Central and South America and Africa are regarded as being
      infected, enquire at the concerned Indian Mission for an up to date list.
      When a case of yellow fever is reported from any country, that country is
      regarded by Government of India as infected with yellow fever and is added
      to the above list.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-16 colorpink">Malaria</h2>
    <p>
      Malaria risk exists throughout the year in the whole country excluding
      parts of the states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Sikkim. No
      certificate is required, but a course of anti malaria pills is recommended
      for all travelers to India.Protect yourself from insects by remaining in
      well-screened areas, using repellents (applied sparingly at 4 hour
      intervals), and wearing long sleeved shirts and long pants from dusk
      through dawn.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-16 colorpink">Cholera</h2>
    <p>
      Travelers proceeding to countries that impose restrictions for arrivals
      from India or from an infected area in India on account of cholera are
      required to possess a certificate. In any case, an inoculation against
      cholera is recommended.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-16 colorpink">General Tips</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-2">
      <li>
        Drink only bottled or boiled water, or carbonated (bubbly) drinks in
        cans or bottles. Avoid tap water, fountain drinks, and ice cubes. If
        this is not possible, make water safer by both filtering through an
        “absolute 1 micron or less” filter AND adding iodine tablets to the
        filtered water. “Absolute 1 micron filters” are found in camping/outdoor
        supply stores.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buy bottled water from respectable outlets to guard against stomach
        upsets. Some of the better-known brands are Bisleri, Kinley, Aqua Fina,
        and Himalaya etc. Make sure that the seal of the bottle is intact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Watch out for spicy dishes, especially at the outset of your tour. Avoid
        eating food from road side stalls. Eat unpeeled fruits and avoid fresh
        salads, especially in small hotels. If you are forced to eat food at
        some place that you have doubts about, make sure the food is served hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always use an insect repellent if you find yourself in a mosquito-prone
        area. But remember, not every place is mosquito-infested and low
        temperatures in winters (when most tourists come to India) kill most
        bugs in the northern plains and hills.
      </li>
      <li>
        If traveling in scorching heat, remember to drink enough water, use
        hats, sunglasses & UV lotions. Do not venture out in the mid day
        sun.Pharmacies or chemists are available in every little town and
        village and you can buy medication. In case you need to see a doctor for
        a specific condition, ask for help from your hotel (most have doctors on
        call) or your tour operator. The cost of visiting a doctor is fairly low
        (less than a dollar) compared to western countries.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="font-16 colorpink">Health Kit</h2>
    <p>
      In India, most modern medicines are available over the counters in
      drugstores, but it is wise to travel with a reserve stock. If any
      prescription drugs are required, bring enough for the duration of the
      trip. It is advisable that you carry a small health kit which should
      include remedy for upset stomachs, some antiseptic cream, mosquito
      repellant cream, suntan/uv lotion, etc.
